Preface
=======

I like docutils and Sphinx.
Because I don't only develop many Python libraries with Sphinx documentation,
but also I think that reStructuredText is good format to write structured documents.

docutils supports converting to LaTeX source code,
and Sphinx supports converting to PDF using LaTeX executable.
But it requires a large size items of LaTeX and need knowledge of LaTeX to customize.
This is important point for lifecycle of writing documentation,
because "Continuous Documentation" is affected from usage machine resources.

This document is demo and short description of rst2typst.
It is simple implementation to convert from reStructuredText to Typst source using docutils.
If you are reStructuredText users , you can experience about PDF generating from plain text rapidly.
